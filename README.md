- 👋 Hi, I’m @wildformat
- 👀 I’m interested in building scalable solutions to challenging problems. I am a huge believer in having strong foundational knowledge over nuanced tooling/language skills. I enjoy 
- studying data structures, algorithms & distributed systems in my spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning docker and kubernetes and their use cases in data science and engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above.
- 📫 How to reach me if you are interested in chatting about anything machine learning or deep learning.
